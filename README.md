# un-parse-able
Encodes your tweets as machine un-readable images to defeat twitter censorship and banning algos

This is an https://extensionizr.com/ template with [fancy-seetings](https://github.com/frankkohlhepp/fancy-settings) enabled.
Your starting point for the script is [inject.js](https://github.com/fyyyyy/un-parse-able/blob/master/src/inject/inject.js) which calls the initPixi method in render.js
The script updates rendering from twitter text input every 500ms.
